REMEMBER the FADING willonly work on a PWM pin.\r\n* halfDuration  = Duration of one sequence going through fadeArray (you need 2 for up and down)  \r\n* flash = if 1 will start flashing \r\n* fadeArray = Array to series of Bytes with the PWM values to be sent to the LED. Default the class has a builtin version\r\n* arraySize = number of entries in fadeArray handed over to the class\r\n\r\n# Methods\r\n\r\n* Update() = Call this once in the loop to update the flashers and leds. Do this for every instance of clHeartbeat\r\n* Start() = start the Fader or Flasher \r\n* Stop() = Stops the Fader or Flasher\r\n* ChangeDuration(unsigned long halfDuration) = Changes the duration of the fading cycle \r\n* ChangeOutputPin(unsigned int pin) = Lets the Fader continue on another pin\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
